# Bikeshare-analysis
In this project, I have used Python to explore data related to bikeshare systems for three major bikeshare systems in the United States. 
I have performed data wrangling to unify the format of data from the three systems and write code to compute descriptive statistics. 
I have also used a package that is not part of the standard Python library to help visualize the data.
